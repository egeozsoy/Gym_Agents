- Pytorch Deep Q Learning for openai gym enviroments
- Mostly used reward maximization. Which means the loss is -1 * expected reward. To minimize the loss, pytorch has to maximize the expected reward.
- I used different resources for coming up with solutions and mention them in my code. Not everything in this repo is my idea.
